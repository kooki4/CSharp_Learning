Feature: Project Library Manager
      In order to perform CRUD operations on the library
      As a Library Manager
      I want to be able to Add, Update, Delete, and View Library content

Scenario: Add new book to the library and verify status.
	Given I add a new book with <Id>, <Title>, <Description> and <Author>
	Then positive <Status> is returned
Examples:
